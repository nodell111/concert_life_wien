                    Viennese concert life in the decades around 1800 provided the setting for one of the most vibrant epochs in music history. The city’s intensive patronage of music made it the destination of hundreds of virtuosi and composers, among them such central figures in the Western classical music canon such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert.

                    The WEAVE project “Concert Life in Vienna 1780–1830”, underway at the University of Vienna and the TU Berlin since July 2022, is tasked with amassing and standardizing all known data on the events, venues, works, and persons during this half century, and seeking out new data in known archival sources.

                    The standalone website will make this research freely available to the public in a relational database with a clean, immersive, and user-friendly interface. Our data on performances includes not only large public spaces (theaters, representative halls), but also aristocratic palaces, multi-function halls, restaurants, and private salons, totaling around 150 locations spread throughout the city.

                    This project is deliverd by Nicole Yeung, Natalie O’Dell, Melissa Ernstberger, and Viktor Kochkin from the international MSc. Cartography programme. As a component of our Digital Cartographic Project, this prototype serves as a foundation that will be further developed into an immersive, interactive web-map experience for our audiences.
